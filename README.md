# Nothing here

I'm hosting some of my code on [disroot's Gitea](https://git.disroot.org/hsv2) instance.

I'm kind of trying to run a community server, as of 2022-10-02 it's in early state but has some presence on the Gemini Space: `gemini://kernel-panic.zone`. Also the [git repositories](https://git.disroot.org/kernel-panic).
